# Projectile-Launch-Sim
https://emanvidmaker.itch.io/projectile-launch-sim

Made for my physics class as my final presentation on visualizing different angles on the projectile launch function.

Controls:
    Move with WASD
    Q-E to move up and down
    Spacebar to enable first person camera rotation
    Scroll wheel to speed up;
    On 2d mode use scroll wheel to zoom in/out

Legend:

    The spheres are the projectiles.
    The color full lines are its trajectory.
    The numbers at the top of the projectile are their angle.
